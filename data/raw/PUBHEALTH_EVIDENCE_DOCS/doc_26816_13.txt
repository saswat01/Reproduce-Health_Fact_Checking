PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE

technical guidance documents
 
regarding 
COVID

WHO is working 
closely 
with International Air Transport Association (
IATA) and have jointly developed a 
guidance document to provide advice to
 
ca
bin crew
 
and airport workers, based on 
country queries. The 
guidance can be found on the 
IATA webpage
. 
 

 
WHO has developed 
a protocol for the investigation of early 
cases (

First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact 
investigation protocol for 2019
-
novel coron
avirus (2019
-
nCoV) infection

)
. The protocol is designed to gain an 
early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of 
COVID
-
19
 
infection detected in 
any individual country, 
to inform the devel
opment and updating of public health 
guidance to manage cases and reduce potential spread and impact of infection. 
 

 
WHO
 
has
 
been
 
in
 
regular
 
and
 
direct
 
contact
 
with
 
Member
 
States
 
where
 
cases
 
have
 
been
 
reported.
 
WHO is also 
informing other countries about th
e situation and providing support as requested.
 

 
WHO has d
eveloped interim guidance for
 
laboratory diagnosis
, 
advice on the use of masks during home care and 
in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019
-
nCoV) outbreak,
 
clinical management
,
 
infection prevention and control in health care settings,
 
home care for patients with suspected novel 
coronavirus
,
 
risk communication and community engagement
 
and 
Global Surveillance for human infection with 
novel coronavirus (2019
-
nCoV)
.
 

 
WHO has p
repared 
disease commodity package
 
that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, 
medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019
-
nCoV.
 
 

 
WHO has p
rovided recommendations to reduce risk of 
transmission from animals to huma
ns
.
 

 
WHO has published an 
updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel 
coronavirus 2019
-
nCoV
.
 

 
WHO has a
ctivat
ed
 
of R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.
 

 
WHO has developed 
online courses on the following topics: 
 
A general introduction to emerging respiratory 
viruses,
 
including novel coronaviruses (available in 
French
, 
Chinese
, and 
Spanish
);  
Critical Care of Severe Acute 
Respiratory
 
Infections
; and 
Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases

WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical to carry out early in an
 
outbreak of a new 
virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance
 
and case 
STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
 
 

o
:
 
 

 
Limit human
-
to
-
human 
transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and 
health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international 
spread from China*;
 
 

 
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, includ
ing providing optimized care for infected patients;
 

 
Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
 

 
Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of di
agnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
 

 
Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
 

 
Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
 
 
*
This can be achieved through a combination of pub
lic health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in 
health
 
care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness
-
rai
sing in the population
 
and 
risk communication.
 
  
 
definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of 
COVID
-
19,
 
help understand spread, 
severity, spectr
um of disease, impact on the community and to
 
inform operational models for implementation of 
countermeasures such as case isolation, contact
 
tracing and isolation.

WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, 
epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clin
ical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the 
disease and limit onward transmission. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, 
which are 
updated 
regularly
.
 

 
WHO is working with 
global expert networks and partnerships for laboratory, i
nfection prevention and control, 
clinical management and mathematical modelling.
 
 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE
 
FOR THE PUBLIC
 
 
If you are not in an area where COVID
-
19 is spreading, or if you have not travelled from one of those areas or have 
not been in clo
se contact with someone who has and is feeling unwell, your chances of getting it are currently low. 

facts to help you accurately determine
 
your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions. (See 
Frequently Asked 
Questions
) Your healthcare provider, your national public health authority and your employer are all potential 
sources of accurate information on COVID
-
19 and whether it is in your area. It is important to be informed of the 
situation where you live and take approp
riate measures to protect yourself. (See  
Protection measures for 
everyone
).
 
If you are in an area where there is an outbreak of COVID
-
19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow 
the advice issued
 
by national and local health authorities. Although for most people COVID
-
19 causes only mild 
illness, it can make some people very ill. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre
-
existing medical conditions (such as high blood
 
pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable. 
(See 
Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID
-
19 is 
spreading
).
