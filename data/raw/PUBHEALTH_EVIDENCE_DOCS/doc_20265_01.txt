 Subscribe to OregonLive.PoliticsOregon Attorney General race comes down to 2 Democrats: Dwight Holton and Ellen RosenblumUpdated Jan 10, 2019; Posted Mar 09, 2012 Facebook ShareTwitter ShareBy       Jeff Manning | The Oregonian/OregonLive      View full sizeThe Oregonian/Ellen RosenblumDwight Holton and Ellen Rosenblum, candidates for Oregon Attorney General.Sixty-eight days before May's primary election, the race between  Attorney General candidatesEllen Rosenblum and Dwight Holtonis shaping  up as a tight battle between two solid, qualified candidates.Rosenblum and Holton share party affiliation and long records as  dedicated public servants whose moderately liberal worldviews are more  similar than different.The race for campaign cash is tight, with a slight edge to Holton.
 As of  Thursday, he'd raised $222,363 to $196,069 for Rosenblum.Rosenblum's campaign got a boost Wednesday when the Association of  Federal, State, County &amp; Municipal Employees Council 75 endorsed  her.
 It is the first of the big three public employees' unions to take a  position.May's primary election will decide the race.
 The Republicans failed to field a candidate by Tuesday's filing deadline.Both candidates enjoy the respect of large swaths of Oregon's legal community.
 "I think either of these candidates could be a good Attorney General,"  said Marc Abrams, an Oregon Justice Department lawyer.
 "This is a race  that offers an interesting contrast in experience.
 But I think they're  both dedicated to delivering the law at the highest level and  encouraging the best people to work at the DOJ.
 "Debating 'home'  Rosenblum characterizes herself as the "local" candidate.
 She's lived  here longer, intends to stay here and is better acquainted with Oregon's  courts, she said.
 "I know the state system," she said.
 "I've been in this business 36  years, 28 of them in the state courts in Portland, Salem and Eugene.
 "As an appeals court judge, she came into frequent contact with state  lawyers.
 "Really, it was like a front-row seat to the Justice  Department," she said.Of Holton, Rosenblum said, "I'm not sure he's ever set foot in an Oregon courtroom.
 "Attorney General CandidatesELLEN ROSENBLUMAge:61Law school:University of OregonJob history:Five years of private practice, eight years as federal prosecutor, 22 years as state court judge.
 Oregon Court of Appeals judge since 2005.Notable case:Represented Ken Kesey in a contract dispute over his screenwriting fee for movie version of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.
 Studio settled with Kesey for nearly $1 million.Setback:Ran unsuccessfully in 2011 for president of American Bar Association.Personal:Married to Richard Meeker, publisher and co-owner of Willamette Week.
 Two grown children.
 Lives in Portland.Quote:"I want to be the people's Attorney General.
 I will stand up for children, families and working men and women across our state.
 "DWIGHT HOLTONAge: 45Law School:University of VirginiaJob history:Five years as assistant U.S. Attorney in New York.
 Seven years, assistant U.S. Attorney in Oregon.
 Nearly two years as acting U.S. Attorney of Oregon.Notable case:Holton led prosecution of an Egyptian shipping company that admitted to dumping oil at sea.
 The company paid $7.25 million, the largest penalty for a water pollution violation in Northwest history.Setback:Tried and failed to get named U.S. Attorney in Virginia and Oregon.Personal:Married to Mary Ellen Glynn, former aide to then-Gov.
 Ted Kulongoski and a deputy press secretary in the Clinton administration.Quote:"The job of the Attorney General is to go to work every day fighting for justice for average Oregonians.
 How cool is that?
 We get to work for justice.
 "Holton's campaign staffers take great umbrage at Rosenblum's remark,  comparing it to criticizing NBA great LeBron James for not playing  college basketball.The Attorney General's job is the extent of her political goals,  Rosenblum said.
 "I have an ambitious vision for the office," she said.
 "But it's not a stepping-stone type ambition.
 "The remark is in reference to the suspicion by some that Holton's  ultimate political aspirations are considerably more lofty than the  Oregon Department of Justice.The son of former Virginia Gov.
 A. Linwood HoltonJr.
 and brother-in-law  to Tim Kaine, another former Virginia governor as well chair of the  Democratic National Committee, Holton has significant connections at the  highest level of the Democratic party.Holton points out that that he and his wife have opted to raise their  family in Southeast Portland rather than Virginia or Washington, D.C.
 They stuck with that even after his wife was offered a plum job in the  Obama State Department.
 "You don't get to choose where you were born but you can control where you live," Holton said.
 "This is our home.
 "Management chopsIf Rosenblum has the edge in her familiarity with the Oregon court system, Holton has more proven management experience.He earned high marks leading the 115-employee U.S. Attorney's office  from February 2010 to October 2011, no mean feat for a guy plucked from  the rank-and-file.Many of his former co-workers in the office are backing him for Attorney  General.
 At least three prosecutors in the office, Allan Garten, Leslie  Westphal and Stacie Beckerman have contributed to Holton's campaign.While Holton proved his management chops at the helm of the U.S.  Attorney's office, what he's particularly proud of are outreach efforts  to folks outside the office.He helped organize local gatherings of law enforcement and health  officials on the growing problem of prescription painkiller abuse, which  kills around 400 Oregonians a year.
 "The best way to deal with crime is to prevent it," he said.Holton first reached out to local Muslims after a man was arrested in an alleged plot to bomb the 2010 tree-lighting festivities at Portland's  Pioneer Square.Days later, a Corvallis mosque was torched.Holton has since hosted functions for Muslim leaders, including parties  at his house and a session at the Hatfield Courthouse with U.S. Attorney  General Eric Holder.
 "He opened his home to our community," said Mozafar Wanly, of theSalman  Al-Farisi Islamic Center in Corvallis.
 "That built trust.
 "Legal split  The race has split Oregon's legal community down the middle.Rosenblum's backers include numerous old-line power brokers.
 Former  Attorney GeneralsDave Frohnmayerand Hardy Myers have endorsed  Rosenblum, as have prominent Portland attorneys like Peter Richter of  the Miller Nash firm, and Mark Long, managing partner for Schwabe  Williamson &amp; Wyatt.Related storyRosenblum's 'vested interest'"I've known her since she was a law student," said Frohnmayer.
 "She's a  voice of high integrity and she knows her way around the law.
 "Rosenblum hopes to become Oregon's first woman Attorney General.
 She's  been endorsed by two other pioneering political women, former Gov.
 Barbara Roberts and former Secretary of State Norma Paulus.A good deal of Holton's money has come from out of state.
 Among his  high-profile backers are U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virg., Kaine, and  high-level Clinton aides John Podesta and DeeDee Myers.But Holton has plenty of local backing.
 Twenty-eight of Oregon's 36 district attorneys endorsed Holton in February.
 "I believe that one of the main reasons so many District Attorneys in  Oregon are supporting Dwight is because we have learned that he truly  understands and supports our work," saidClackamas County District  Attorney John Foote.-- Jeff ManningNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
