FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 18, 2002 WWW.USDOJ.GOV  CIV (202) 514-2007 TDD (202) 514-1888     PRESS STATEMENT RE: HCA      For a number of years, the Department, working with private  whistleblower-plaintiffs and their attorneys, has been in litigation with HCA  (the former Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation) concerning its billing  practices and conduct with respect to its charging of Medicare, Medicaid and  other federally funded health care programs.
 This litigation has included  allegations of overcharging the government on HCA's cost reports, payment of  kickbacks and other improper remuneration to physicians in exchange for  referral of patients, and overcharging in connection with the company's  agreements for management of its wound care facilities.
 During this time we  have had discussions with HCA about resolving this civil litigation.
 The staff  assigned to this matter has now reached a tentative understanding with HCA for  a settlement of $631 million.
 If formally approved, this settlement would  resolve the litigation as well as HCA's administrative liability to the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for an additional $250 million, but  would be conditioned on a number of future events.
 Any formal agreement must  be authorized by appropriate Department officials in consultation with the  affected agencies.
 When added to the prior civil and criminal settlements  reached in 2000, this settlement would bring the government's total recoveries  from HCA to approximately $1.7 billion.
