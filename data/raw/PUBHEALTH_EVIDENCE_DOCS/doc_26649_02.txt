SUBJECT IN FOCUS: 
Update on partner coordination with 
international travel, transport 
and tourism sectors
 
 
As the
 
on
-
going 
Coronavirus Disease (COVID
-
19) 
pandemic 
continues to develop, 
WHO
 
is committed to working 
together with the travel,
 
transport and
 
tourism sectors on emergency preparedness and response. 
 
 
In a global world with hyperconnected international travel and transport, 
points of entry 
(PoEs)

 
airports, ports and 
ground crossings 

 
can play a key
 
role in the international sprea
d of diseases through travellers, conveyances and 
goods. The travel and transport sectors are indispensable actors in 
public health emergency preparedness and 
response actions related to
 
PoEs
.
 
 
WHO has pub
lished three joint statements to remind all stakeho
lders of the importance of following 
I
nternational 
H
ealth
 
R
egulations
 
and guidance
, existing regulations of partner organizations,
 
and
 
the 
need for cross
-
sector 
collaboration. 
The joint statements were released respectively, with the 
International Maritime Organization
 
(IMO), 
the 
International Civil Aviation Organization
 
(ICAO) and the 
World Tourism Organization
 
(UNWTO).
 
 
With input from IMO, ICAO, 
the International Air Transport Association (IATA)
 
and UNWTO as well as major industry 
associations, WHO has produced and continues to develop comprehensive COVID
-
19 tec
hnical guidance on maritime
 
and 
aviation
 
traffic
 
and ground crossings.
 
T
hese include:
 

 
Operational considerations for manag
ing COVID
-
19 cases and outbreaks on board ships (Interim guidance)
;
 

 
Management of ill travellers at Points of Entry 

 
international 
airports, seaports and ground crossings 

 
in 
the context of COVID
-
19 outbreak
;
 

 
Public health preparedness and response for aviation sector
;
 

 
Operational con
siderations for managing COVID
-
19 cases/outbreak on board ships
; and the
 

 
Handbook for the management of public heal
th events on board ships
.
 
 
Additionally, guidance on operational consi
derations for managing COVID
-
19 cases and outbreak in aviation, scaling 
up preparedness for COVID
-
19 at ground crossings, and managing COVID
-
1
9
 
cases and outbreaks in hotels and other 
t
ravel and 
tourism accommodations are under development and will be available soon.
 
 
 
WHO also regularly updates travel advice to support emergency preparedness, which is available 
here
. 
ICAO is also 
publishing a 
dedicated website with specific resources
, and guidance for airlines industries and national authorities. 
Similarly, 
IMO
 
and 
UNWTO
 
host dedicated websites with resources and guidance for their members and 
stakeholders.

Case classifications are
 
based on 
WHO case 
definitions
 
for 
COVID

.
 
 
§
T
ransmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subj
ect to reclassification as additional data 
become 
available. Countries/territories/areas exper
iencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is 
evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interrupti
on of transmission can be demonstrated. It 
should be noted that even within 
categories, differ
ent countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and
 
other factors. Not all locations wit
hin a given country/territory/area are equa
lly affected.
 
Terms: 
 
-
 
Community transmission
 
is evi
denced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by 
increasing positive tests through sentinel sam
ples (routine systematic testing of respira
tory samples from established laboratories).
 
-
 
Local 
transmission 
indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
 
-
 
Imported cases only 
indicates locations where all cases have been
 
acquired outside the location of reporting
.  
 
-
 
Under investigation
 
indicates locations where t
ype of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
 
-
 
Interrupted transmission 
indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (
details to be determined)

RATEGIC OBJECTIVES
 
 

o
:
 
 

 
Interrupt human
-
to
-
human transmission including reducing secondary infections among clos
e 
contacts 
and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventi
ng further 
international spread*;
 
 

 
Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
 

 
Identify and reduce tr
an
smission from the animal source;
 

 
Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, exten
t of transmission and infection, treatment 
options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
 

 
Communicate critical risk and event 
in
formation to all communities and counter misinformation;
 

 
Minimize social and economic impact
 
through multisectoral partnerships.
 
 
*
This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis 
and managemen
t 
of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control
 
in 
health
 
care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness
-
raising in the population
 
and 
risk communication.

RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICE
 
FOR THE PUBLIC
 
 
If you are not in an area where COVID
-
19 is 
spreading or
 
have not travelled from an area where COVID
-
19 is 
spread
ing or
 
have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is
 
understandable that 
you may feel anxious about the outbreak. 
G
et the facts from reliable sources to help
 
you accurately determine your 
 risks so that you can take
 
reasonable precautions (
s
ee 
Frequently Asked Questions
). Seek guidance from WHO, your 
healthcare provider, your national pu
blic health authority or your employer for accurate infor
mation on COVID
-
19 
and whether COVID
-
19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be i
nformed of the situation and take 
appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see 
Protection measures for everyone
).
 
 
If you are in an area wher
e there 
are cases
 
of COVID
-
19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the 
advice of WHO 
and guidance issued by national and local health authorit
ies. 
F
or most people
,
 
COVID
-
19 infect
ion
 
will cause mild illness
 
however
, it can make some peo
ple very ill 
and, in some people, it
 
can be fatal. Older people, 
and those with pre
-
existing medical cond
itions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respirato
ry disease or 
diabetes) 
are
 
at risk for severe disease (See 
Protection measures for persons who are i
n or have recently visited (past 
14 days) areas where COVI
D
-
19 is spreading
).
 
 
 
CASE DEFINITIONS
 
 
WHO periodically updates the 
Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus
 
disease (COVID
-
19)
 
document which includes case definitions. 
 
 
 
For ea
sy reference, case def
initions are included below. 
 
 
Suspect case
 
A.
 
A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g., 
cough, sho
rtness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the cl
inical presentation AN
D a 
history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See 
situation 
report
) 
of 
COVID
-
19 disease during the 14 da
ys prior to symptom onset.
 
OR
 
B.
 
A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID
-
19 case (see definition o
f contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;
 
OR
 
C.
 
A patient with severe acute resp
iratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease 
(e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalization
 
AND with no other etio
logy that fully explains 
the clinical 
presentation.
 
 
Probable case
 
 
A suspect case for whom te
sting for COVID
-
19 is inconclusive
. 
 

 
Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory
 
 
Confirmed case
 
 
A person with laboratory confirmation o
f COVID
-
19 infection, irrespective of 
clinical signs and symptoms.
