According to this study, an estimated 0.6% of the adult population over the age of 18 are transgender, about 1.4 million adults.
 So it actually indicates that the percentage is much higher than 1 in 300 (0.3%).
 The 1-in-300 figure is a 2014 estimate by the Williams Institute based on older data collected from just two states.
 This report, meanwhile, relies on more recent data from a much larger sample size that spans across many states.
 (Some transgender people are more familiar with the older 1-in-300 figure, which is probably why you've heard some people referring to that number.)
 A separate Williams Institute study, available here, provides estimates for youth between the ages of 13 and 17, and estimates that 0.7% of youth in that age group, or about 150,000 people, are transgender.
 Currently, there is no comprehensive national estimate for the number of transgender people under the age of 13.
 Texas has one of the highest percentages of transgender people in the country: 0.66% of the adult population (125,350 adults) and 0.73% of the population between the ages of 13 and 17 (13,800 youths).
 So in Texas, that's just around 1 in every 152 adults and 1 in every 137 teens between the ages of 13 and 17.

 Are you aware of survey research or other studies specific to the Texas population?
 According to the institute’s 2016 report, Texas was not among the 19 states where the CDC survey extended to asking the relevant question.6:26 p.m.I'm not personally aware of estimates of the transgender population specific to Texas.
 You might find it helpful to reach out to the authors of the report.
 I think they'll be able to share more details about their methodology and about how they reached their Texas estimates, and they might also be aware of other studies relevant to that issue.
 You can find their emails here: http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/by-name.
 As far as other Texas-specific research goes, the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, a national survey exploring the experiences of transgender people, included a brief Texas breakout report in addition to the more detailed national report.
