These substances are increasingly available in the United States and are more potent than heroin or morphine.
 Even small amounts equivalent to a few grains of salt can be deadly, and in addition to more traditional methods of administration, can be easily inhaled or absorbed through the skin.
 These substances pose an extreme risk, not only to users, but also to law enforcement and first responders who encounter these substances in the course of their work.
 Fentanyl Fentanyl is a powerful opioid similar to morphine, but 50 to 100 times more potent.
 Legal pharmaceutical fentanyl is used for treating severe pain after surgery or advanced cancer pain.
 Federally, it is a Schedule II controlled substance, but illicitly manufactured fentanyl is increasingly blamed for opioid deaths when it is mixed with heroin or other drugs.
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, during 2013-2014 the number of drug products obtained by law enforcement that tested positive for fentanyl increased by 426 percent, and synthetic opioid–involved overdose deaths (excluding methadone) increased by 79 percent in the United States.
 A few states have responded to this growing problem by scheduling illicit forms of fentanyl and creating trafficking penalties.

 Carfentanil      Carfentanil is another extremely potent opioid that is chemically related to fentanyl.
 It is 100 times more potent than fentanyl and 10,000 times more potent than morphine.
 Federally, it is a Schedule II narcotic that has not been approved for human use.
 Until its recent illicit use by humans it was used only in veterinary medicine as a general anesthetic for large animals.
 In the examples above, Kentucky has singled out carfentanil alongside other opioids in their trafficking provisions.
 Acetyl Fentanyl Acetyl fentanyl is a synthetic opioid chemically very similar to the drug fentanyl but has not been approved for medical use and has now been banned in numerous states.
 The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has additional information on this substance on its webpage.
 Update: On Nov. 9, 2017, the DEA announced its intent to schedule all fentanyl-related substances on an emergency basis.

 Synthetic Drugs: Cannabinoids and Cathinones Since 2011, all 50 states have banned two types of synthetic drugs­—cannabinoids (a.k.a.
 “synthetic marijuana”, “Spice” or “K2”) and cathinones (a.k.a.
 “bath salts”) —with the majority doing so via legislation.
 Types of Synthetic Drugs      Synthetic Cannabinoids are chemically engineered substances similar to tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”), the active ingredient in marijuana.
 When smoked or ingested, the high can mimic that of marijuana but also can result in more severe reactions.
 Synthetic Cathinones, commonly known by their street name, “bath salts,” are a bi-product of cathinone, a psychoactive substance found in the khat plant.
 They can be inhaled or ingested and the high is similar to amphetamines like ecstasy or cocaine.
 Initially, state legislative action targeted specific versions of these drugs with individual bans.
 Minor changes to the chemical composition of these substances, however, can create new, but very similar, drugs not previously covered by law.
 In response, legislation in subsequent years has been more general in nature, targeting entire classes of substances or using broad language to describe the prohibited drugs and their effects.
 More recently, a few states also have passed laws restricting marketing, display, labeling, and advertising of these substances by utilizing consumer protection laws or classifying these activities as deceptive trade practices.
 Where substances are not specifically banned, law enforcement and prosecutors have also creatively used existing provisions such as agricultural regulations, consumer protection laws, and public nuisance laws to prosecute those selling these drugs.
 Types of State Laws Restricting Synthetic Drugs   TYPE SUMMARY     Individual Bans Individual substances are added to controlled substance schedules using their trade/street names or the chemical structure of a substance.
 Examples of banned synthetic cannabinoids include JWH-018, HU-210 and CP 47,497, and the four most commonly prohibited synthetic cathinones are mephedrone, MDPV, methylone and methedrone.
 Class Bans   Groups of structurally similar synthetic drugs are banned by scheduling a structural “class.” Laws define the chemical characteristics of the structural class and sometimes list examples of individual substances that fall within the class.
 Examples of classes that have been identified in statute include: adamantoylindoles, adamantoylindazoles, benzoylindoles, cyclohexylphenols, cyclopropanoylindoles, naphthoylindoles, naphthoylnaphthalenes, naphthoylpyrroles, naphthylmethylindenes, naphthylmethylindoles, phenylacetylindoles, quinolinylindolecarboxylates, tetramethylcyclopropanoylindoles, tetramethylcyclopropane-thiazole carboxamides, substituted phenethylamines, and substituted tryptamines.
 Analogue Laws   Substances that are not classified as controlled substances, but are structurally similar to substances that are scheduled are banned by analogue laws.
 Generally, these laws require that the analogue drug be substantially similar in chemical structure and intoxicating (pharmacological) effects as a scheduled controlled substance.
 According to the National Alliance for Model State Drug Laws, 34 states have analogue laws, and a number of states have amended their analogue laws to specifically address emerging synthetic substances.
 Neurochemical Approach   Substances are banned based on the effects they have on the brain rather than by individual name or class.
 For example, Colorado §18-18-102 (34.5) defines “synthetic cannabinoid” as, “any chemical compound that is chemically synthesized and either: (I) Has been demonstrated to have binding activity at one or more cannabinoid receptors; or (II) is a chemical analog or isomer of a compound that has been demonstrated to have binding activity at one or more cannabinoid receptors.”     Administrative Actions   Some states have delegated scheduling authority to pharmacy boards or other agencies to quickly ban substances when they are identified.
 Some state legislatures have authorized agencies to pass temporary bans that will then be reviewed and codified by the legislature after a specified period of time, while others have given agency bans the full force and effect of statutory law.
 Examples: Minnesota and New York     Non-Criminal Approaches   States have used other legal strategies aside from criminal prosecution to reign in the supply of synthetic drugs.
 The following are examples of legal provisions that have been utilized:  Business licensure Nuisance abatement Consumer protection Product labeling and branding regulation      Westlaw was used to conduct this research.
