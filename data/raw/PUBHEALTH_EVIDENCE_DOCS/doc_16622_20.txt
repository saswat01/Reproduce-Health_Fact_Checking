He favored additional inquiry, citing insufficient expert testimony and a paucity of public documents regarding the insurance matters.

 \"I think it is important that we get this information.\"His plea fell on deaf ears.Commission chairman Ronald Brise said his parents are among Duke's 1.7 million customers, and he understands the concerns customers have about the spending.
 But he said he believes the agreement was a good deal.\"It is a difficult situation across the board,\" Brise concluded Thursday afternoon.

 \"I'm not saying this settlement is something that we … celebrated and had champagne over.\"Some consumers urged the PSC to delay a decision on the settlement to provide time to hold hearings in Duke's Central Florida service area so commissioners could hear from ratepayers themselves.Commissioners rejected the request, saying the law did not allow them to take testimony in this kind of case other than from expert witnesses.
 The commission, however, allowed consumers who traveled to Tallahassee for the first day of settlement hearings on Wednesday to speak for three minutes each.Commissioners also said budgetary constraints prevented them from making such a trip other than when a utility is requesting a rate increase.
 In those cases, the law allows consumers to talk to the commission about the quality of service their utility delivers.The group \"Stop Duke Rip-Off\" sent an email to the PSC on Thursday offering donations it was receiving to help pay for the commissioners' trip to the community.

 \"If anything they've been a toothless lapdog.\"I don't see how they have benefited us, the public, in any way shape or form, which calls into question the value of the PSC in its current form,\" he said.Duke's critics dubbed the Crystal River nuclear facility the \"Humpty Dumpty\" plant after cracks in the concrete led to its demise.Duke spent hundreds of millions of dollars replacing the plant's old steam generators.
 The spending escalated after the utility cut into the 42-inch-thick concrete reactor containment building and it cracked.
 Questions arose about why the utility decided to self manage the project, when every other utility that successfully completed similar upgrades had hired an outside contractor to oversee the work.
 Duke's plan for preparing and then cutting the wall also differed from the way it was done at other plants.Attempts to repair the wall and bring the reactor back online led to more cracks.
 In February, Duke announced Crystal River's closure.
 The upgrades, repairs and replacement power Duke was forced to purchase resulted in more than $3 billion in expenses.At the same time, Duke was seeking a license to build two new reactors less than 10 miles north of the Crystal River plant in Levy County.A law passed in 2006 enabled the utility to charge customers ahead of the plant coming online for siting, planning, development and financing charges.
 The \"advance fee\" or \"pay-as-you-go\" law shifted the risk of starting a nuclear project from investors to utility customers.
 The initial price tag was $4 billion to $6 billion.
 It quickly escalated, eventually reaching more than $24 billion.
 Duke ended up spending about $1 billion and generated $300 million to $500 million in financing charges before scuttling the project earlier this year.Dudley pointed to the so-called \"advance fee\" laws for nuclear as a major reason the costs got so out of control.
 The Legislature, Dudley said, needs to \"sharpen the stake and drive it through the heart of the utilities when it comes to nuclear cost recovery.\"Duke plans to try to sell components it purchased toward Levy to reduce customers' obligation, but it remains to be seen whether they'll find buyers.Rehwinkel, the deputy public counsel, said a prime benefit of the settlement agreement is that the customers' tab for Levy can not rise any higher.\"The Levy project is dead,\" Rehwinkel said.
 \"That was one of the things we thought was important — to exterminate the Levy project.\"Sterling Ivey, a Duke spokesman, said the settlement provides long-term certainty and stabilizes rates for years.\"It is fair and represents a good value for our customers,\" Ivey said.
 Customers will pay more, though.
 The average residential customer's monthly rate will increase by $8.24 on Jan. 1 to $124.30 per 1,000 kilowatt hours.Expect even more charges to come.As part of the settlement, Duke wants to pursue another as-yet-undisclosed power generating source to build or buy by 2017 and to build two natural gas plants in 2018 and 2020.
 They will have to prove that the extra power is needed before moving forward.
 There also will be charges related to storage of the nuclear fuel left at the Crystal River site.

 We are seeing increased home sales in existing and new communities throughout the SouthShore area.
 SouthShore is the ideal ecotourism destination in Hillsborough County featuring two scenic rivers with inlets pouring in to open bay water inviting endless enjoyment for all.
 Our second largest event is the Apollo Beach Manatee Festival of the Arts, which is held the second weekend in March.
 There is a pride of belonging and being part of this community.
 Residents and business owners have always been proud to call this their home.
 We have it all: education, medical, arts and culture, industrial, agriculture, residential, tourism and retail.
 They take care of one another.
 That community has much to give back, the SouthShore Chamber of Commerce executive director says.
 The additional money could help hospitals cover charity care, provide premium support for low-income Floridians or expand health care programs.
 Matt Hudson, a Naples Republican and chairman of the House's health care budget committee, said it's best to keep the two discussions separate.
 But it's hardly enough, health care officials say, and less than what states like Texas and California receive.
 California collects about $5 billion a year for similar programs and Texas expects $7.5 billion each year, the same study said.
 The waiver application will be submitted in about a month.
 Most likely, the federal government will insist on new quality improvement benchmarks as a trade-off for any new money.
 The federal health care law also reduces some supplemental funding hospitals now receive.
 And that means hospitals and health centers will always need this supplemental money, she said.
 That will allow the Legislature time to pass any laws needed to implement it for the 2014-15 fiscal year.
 Now, they may be needed to sign off on how any new dollars are allocated.
 A new majority on the Hillsborough County Commission could consider new growth policies including higher impact fees, disallowing construction along substandard roads and making it easier for public involvement in rezoning hearings.

 Florida voters voted on Tuesday to raise the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour over six years, which advocates say will benefit hundreds of thousands of workers in the Sunshine State's service-heavy economy but which opponents say will stifle industry growth.
