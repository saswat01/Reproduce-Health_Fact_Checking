 "The proposal hides the fact that the Amendment would make Florida one of the most lenient medical-marijuana states," says Bondi's initial court brief.The amendment backers, People United for Medical Marijuana, say opponents are twisting the truth and preventing the sick from legally obtaining help.
 "Any statement that the initiative would allow unfettered use of medical marijuana would itself be misleading to voters," wrote People United's lawyer, John Mills.Mills accused Bondi and opponents of dressing up inaccurate campaign-trail talking points as technical legal arguments to keep Florida from being the 21st state to decriminalize marijuana for medical and other reasons.For the past three years, medical marijuana bills have died in the Florida Legislature, where leaders wouldn't even schedule a vote.People United, a political committee, says it's acting because the Legislature failed to.
